To get started, you will need one of each:

- `initramfs.cpio.gz`
    - My Recommendation (by @hippie68) / https://github.com/hippie68/psxitarch-how-to/releases/tag/v1.00
- `bzImage`
    - My Recommendation (by @huzhekun) / https://github.com/huzhekun/ps4-linux-5.3.7/releases
    - Wi-Fi not working? / https://www.mediafire.com/file/amiftcy4lof71ep/bzImage.bin/file

For more information about alternatives, check out @hippie68's guide:

You will also need:

    - Best chance is to get it from the official source / https://archive.archlinux.org/iso/
